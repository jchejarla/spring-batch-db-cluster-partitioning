## [2.0.0] â€“ 2025-08-01

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

- **Artifact renamed** from `clustering-core` to `spring-batch-db-cluster-core`.  
  â¤· Update your `pom.xml`:
  ```xml
  <dependency>

      <artifactId>spring-batch-db-cluster-core</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
### âœ¨ New Features

- Added **Spring Boot Actuator integration** to improve observability of the distributed batch cluster.
- Introduced a new actuator endpoint:
  - `GET /actuator/batch-cluster`  
    â†’ Returns status of all active nodes in the cluster, including heartbeat, last update time, and partition assignments.
  - `GET /actuator/batch-cluster/{nodeId}`  
    â†’ Returns execution details for the specified node, such as assigned partitions, their status, and timestamps.
- Enhanced `/actuator/health` to reflect overall Spring Batch cluster health status, providing readiness and heartbeat validation.
